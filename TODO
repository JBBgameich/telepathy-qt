telepathy-qt4:
General:
- Create high-level classes for basic types where we expose keys as strings.
  Note that probably all wrapper classes should have a way to be created using the
  the original type (ChannelClass, QVariantMap, ..) directly
- We should probably add a high-level class to represent immutable properties also.
- Connection::capabilities should not return 0 if FeatureCore is enabled but not
  connected.
- Discuss about whether to merge cmake support
- Be more Qt like (using Q_D, Q_Q, etc)
- Change all examples to use handler/approver/observer/etc.
- Remove all xxxInterface methods
- Make Contact a RefCounted and make its features use Tp::Feature
- Add missing fancy headers
- Remove all accessors that return object path where appropriate as in most PendingOperation classes
  that have it.
- Make sure signals have the Tp:: namespace.
- Make ManagerFile and KeyFile internal to the library and probably RefCounted.
- Manager::getParameter should have a const qualifier.
- Discuss class hierarchy of DBusProxy. Whether DBusProxy should inherit ReadyObject/RefCounted.
- Make all tp-qt4 inherited QObjects support property notify as done by Account. Probably adding a
  new Tp::Object.
