telepathy-qt4 0.1.2 (UNRELEASED)
================================

Dependencies:

* Full regression tests now require telepathy-glib >= 0.7.27 (telepathy-glib
  is still optional)

* telepathy-farsight >= 0.0.4 is a new optional dependency

API changes:

* AccountManager, Account, ConnectionManager, Connection, Channel
  now inherit QSharedData and are used together with
  QExplicitlySharedDataPointer.
  This is needed so we can create shared pointers based on the object itself,
  instead of doing hacks to find the shared pointer related to a given object.
  See http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/telepathy/2009-March/003168.html for
  more details.

* Channel Features are now Feature objects, not integers

* The Feature class is now in its own header, <TelepathyQt4/Client/Feature>

Enhancements:

* The skeletal StreamedMediaChannel class from 0.1.0 has been expanded to
  cover all the functionality of the Telepathy StreamedMedia interface

* PendingConnection, PendingAccount etc. have serviceName and objectPath
  methods where necessary, so that objects of custom classes can be
  constructed

* Features can now be considered critical, meaning that failure to set them up
  leads to failure of becomeReady() - this should only be used for features
  that should never fail unless the service is buggy, like Connection and
  Channel core functionality

* examples/call/ is an example of how to use StreamedMediaChannel, which can
  make and receive XMPP Jingle calls using telepathy-gabble
  (this feature requires telepathy-farsight and GStreamer)

Fixes:

* When introspection of a Feature fails, the D-Bus error is propagated as the
  failure reason of becomeReady()

* Fix a memory leak in TextChannel

telepathy-qt4 0.1.1 (2009-03-05)
================================

The "PresencePublicationAuthorizationRequestRejection" release.

API changes:

* PendingReadyAccount, PendingReadyAccountManager, PendingReadyConnection,
  PendingReadyConnectionManager have all been replaced by the PendingReady
  class

* Account, AccountManager, Connection and ConnectionManager features are now
  QSet<uint>, not bitfields

* Plural contacts are generally represented by a QSet<QSharedPointer<Contact> >
  instead of a QList<QSharedPointer<Contact> > (with a new typedef,
  Telepathy::Client::Contacts, which must be used in signal/slot connections)

Enhancements:

* Added Connection::FeatureRoster, which, when enabled, adds contact list
  (a.k.a. roster/buddy list) functionality to the ContactManager and
  Contact objects

* Improved maintainability of Account, AccountManager, Connection and
  ConnectionManager becoming ready

* A QSharedPointer<Contact> is now hashable with qHash, meaning contacts can
  be QSet or QHash members

* Added a trivial contact list user interface, examples/roster/roster

Fixes:

* The client library no longer attempts to enforce group add/remove flags:
  whatever change the user requests is passed on to the connection manager
  (which might reject it)

* PendingReady objects returned by Connection::becomeReady() have the
  Connection as parent, rather than an internal object that isn't useful
  to library users

telepathy-qt4 0.1.0 (2009-02-26)
================================

The "pending operation" release.

This first release of telepathy-qt4 features high-level API for the following:

* Manipulating accounts on a Telepathy AccountManager implementation as
  described by telepathy-spec 0.17.x, such as Mission Control 5 (beta versions
  currently available)

* Manipulating Telepathy connection managers via the ConnectionManager and
  Connection core API

* Setting your own presence on a connection manager supporting the
  SimplePresence interface

* Requesting channels from a connection manager supporting the Requests
  interface

* Reading contacts' aliases etc. on a connection manager supporting the
  Contacts interface

* Sending and receiving messages on Text channels, with or without the
  Messages interface

In addition, lower-level auto-generated accessors are provided for all the
functionality of telepathy-spec version 0.17.19.

Notable functionality that is currently missing, but will be added soon,
includes:

* Manipulating a server-stored contact list

* Controlling VoIP calls in StreamedMedia channels
